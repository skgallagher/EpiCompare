\Abstract{
We present \pkg{EpiCompare}, an \proglang{R} package that suppliments
and enhances current infectious disease analysis pipelines and
encourages comparisons across models and epidemics. A major contribution
of this work is the set of novel \textit{time-invariate} tools for model
and epidemic comparisons - including time-invariate prediction bands.
\pkg{EpiCompare} embraces \proglang{R}'s \textit{tidy} coding style to
make adoption of the package easier and analysis faster. This paper
provides an overview of both the tools in and intuition behind
\pkg{EpiCompare} and a thorough demonstrating of the tools through a
detailed example of a full data analysis pipeline.

\section[Intro]{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The recent (and on-going) COVID-19 global pandemic has galvanized public
interest in understanding more about infectious disease modeling and has
highlighted the usefulness of research in the area of infectious disease
epidemiology. Infectious diseases inflict enormous burdens on the world:
millions of lives lost and trillions of dollars spent yearly. Infectious
disease models typically attempt to do one or more of the following: 1)
predict the spread of current and future epidemics
\citep[e.g. flu prediction][]{Biggerstaff2016}, 2) analyze past and
current epidemics to increase scientific knowledge
\citep[e.g. historical measle outbreaks][]{Neal2004}, and 3) forecast or
project epidemic scenarios under pre-specified parameters
\citep[e.g.][]{ferguson2020}. At the same time, descriptive statistics
and visualizations from universities, many branches and levels of
government, and news organizations are an important first step of the
process
\textcolor{violet}{as has been seen in the current COVID-19 epidemic}\citep{dong2020,cdc-covid-tracker2021,wp-covid-tracker2021}.
\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: probably should have a conclusion sentence here - seems to end abruptly. *This is less so the case now.]}}

With the many visualization and exploratory tools, models and modeling
paradigms, and reviews and comparisons in the literature and through the
MIDAS (Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study) network
\citep{midasnetwork2021}, this field has a lot of devices to aid an
individual practitioner decide the correct approach. For example,
\proglang{R} packages such as \pkg{surveillance}, \pkg{EpiModel}, and
\pkg{pomp} have all made significant steps in standardizing the flow of
the data analysis pipeline for epidemic modeling through digitizing data
sets, making accessible statistical models, and providing a plethora of
educational material for both coding novices and experts alike
\citep{surveillance2017,Jenness2018,King2016}.

At the same time, analysis packages often only address a specific
portion of the analysis
pipeline\textcolor{violet}{\sout{, for instance focusing on certain types of models.}}
\textcolor{violet}{These m}odeling
tools\textcolor{violet}{\sout{, which}} usually require learning
package-specific syntax\textcolor{violet}{\sout{,}} and often don't
provide easy ways to compare and assess their models on new data.
Moreover, exploring\textcolor{violet}{, \sout{and}} modeling
\textcolor{violet}{and comparing} epidemics require transforming and
\textit{tidying} data in different ways. To fill these gaps, we present
our \proglang{R} package \pkg{EpiCompare}. Our package's primary focus
is to aid and advance research in the area of comparison and assessment
of epidemic and epidemiological models. In Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}, we
illustrate the data analysis pipeline of infectious diseases as 1) data
pre-processing, 2) exploratory data analysis (EDA), 3) modeling and
simulating, 4) post-processing, and 5) comparison and assessment; where
each previous part of the pipeline influences the next. \pkg{EpiCompare}
provides tools to aids practitioners in all areas of this pipeline.

    \includegraphics[width = 1\textwidth]{images/pipeline1.png}
    \caption{An idealized epidemiological data analysis pipeline.}
    \label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

\pkg{EpiCompare} also emphasizes the value of analyzing epidemics in a
\textit{time-invariant} way. Epidemics, despite by definition being a
process that evolves over time, often need to be compared in a way not
constrained to initial times or time scales to understand the processes
at play.
\textcolor{violet}{Time-invariant analysis can also make it easier to compare state-space models in a more global, holistic fashion. \sout{Moreover, m} M}any
current \textcolor{violet}{time-dependent} comparison tools for
state-space models (e.g.~SIR models)
\textcolor{violet}{\sout{highlight} examine} the proportion of
individuals in each state (at a given time) in a piece-wise / marginal
fashion. \textcolor{violet}{These \sout{This}}
approach\textcolor{violet}{es} may reduce the amount of connections that
can be seen, similar to projections of a multidimensional distribution
onto a single axis at a time. Tools in \pkg{EpiCompare} give the user
the ability to extend their toolkit to evaluate epidemics within a
time-invariant lens. The goal of \pkg{EpiCompare} is not to supplant
existing infectious disease modeling tools and software but, rather, is
a concerted effort to create standard and fair comparisons among models
developed for disease outbreaks and outbreak data.

This paper is broken up into the following sections; section
\ref{sec:time-invariant} motivates and showcases tools of time-invariant
analysis, section \ref{sec:overview} presents an outline of how
\pkg{EpiCompare} aids a practitioner in every step of the pipeline and
section \ref{sec:tour} provides a \textcolor{violet}{\sout{thorough}}
demonstrating of the tools through a detailed example of a full data
analysis pipeline.

\section[Time-invariant]{Motivation and tools for time-invariant
analysis}\label{sec:time-invariant}

\pkg{EpiCompare} delivers \textit{time-invariant} analysis by (1) taking
a global, not marginal view of how epidemics move through populations
and (2) by treating full epidemics as filamental trajectories. The
following section aims to highlight the strengths of
\textit{time-invariant} \textcolor{orange}{analysis} and define the
mathematical foundations that \pkg{EpiCompare}'s tools stand upon.

Mathematically, epidemics are complex objects. They can be hard to
assess and compare to one another due to the differences in the
diseases, the location where the outbreak occurs, how the affected
population reacts, and the time
\sout{related}\textcolor{orange}{related} features (including start of
the epidemic, speed of infection and more). Time-invariant analysis
makes different epidemics easier to compare by removing many time
dependent aspects of an epidemic. \sout{Instead,}
\textcolor{orange}{Time-invariant analysis} focuses
\textcolor{orange}{on the global pattern of an epidemic, via filamental trajectories,  and emphasizes the number of lives affected.}
\textcolor{violet}{[Ben wants to try this sentence again.]}

\subsection[motivating through R0]{Motivating time-invariant analysis
through the reproduction number \(R_0\)}\label{sec:r0}

Time-invariant analysis, as it appears in \pkg{EpiCompare},
\textcolor{orange}{bypasses} many difficulties \textcolor{orange}{in}
comparing different epidemics. With time-invariant analysis, comparing
the decades-long outbreak of HIV in the US to a 10 day outbreak of
norovirus on a cruise ship is \sout{still} possible. Time-dependent
problems can arise when estimating epidemiological parameters, including
the reproduction number \(R_0\).
\sout{\textcolor{violet}{We will use $R_0$ to motivate the usefulness of time-invariant analysis in this section.}}\footnote{\textcolor{orange}{I don't think this is a necessary sentence.}
  \textcolor{violet}{I still think it adds value to the story and I'm not sure people really read section titles that are long.}}

\(R_0\) is probably the most famous \sout{time-invariant} numerical
summary of an epidemic and is often associated with the
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model \citep{hethcote2000}.
\(R_0\) is \sout{a one-number summary of a disease and is }defined as
the expected number of infections caused by a single infector who is
added to a completely susceptible population \citep{anderson1992}.
\textcolor{violet}{This \textcolor{orange}{definition has no mention of time and hence} means that $R_0$ is a time-invariant parameter\textcolor{orange}{. Yet $R_0$ is} estimated with time-\sout{based}\textcolor{orange}{dependent} data, which can make it a difficult quantity to estimate.}
\textcolor{orange}{For example, \cite{Gallagher2020} demonstrate how $R_0$ can be sensitive to time-\sout{based}\textcolor{orange}{dependent} parameters such as the beginning and end of an epidemic, two quantities that generally are}\textcolor{violet}{hard to define precisely.\sout{do not have precise definitions}}.
To demonstrate the difficulty of discerning \(R_0\) in
\textcolor{violet}{\sout{a}other}\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{I change this so we don't confused readers that we're going show the impact in tools beyond just the estimation itself.}}
time-dependent analysis, we first introduce \citet{Kermack1927}'s SIR
model. This model captures the transitions from one state to the next as
a system of ordinary differential equations, where \(N\) is the total
number of individuals, \(\beta\) is the rate of infection, and
\(\gamma\) is the rate of recovery,

\begin{align}\label{eq:sir-ode}
    S^\prime(t) &= -\frac{\beta S(t)I(t)}{N} \\
    I^\prime(t) &= \frac{\beta S(t)I(t)}{N} - \gamma I(t) \nonumber\\
    R^\prime(t) &= \gamma I(t) \nonumber.
\end{align}

From this
model,\textcolor{orange}{the reproduction number is the ratio of the infection rate to the recovery rate,}
\(R_0 = \beta/\gamma\)\sout{, aka the ratio of the infection rate compared to the recovery rate.}
\textcolor{violet}{From this definition, given 
\sout{Since}} \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) are both rates,
\textcolor{violet}{it should be clear that} the ratio of the two,
\(R_0\), is a time-invariant
quantity.\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{I am trying to make it look like we are not repeating ourselves by saying $R_0$ is time-invariant.}}
\sout{ Once $R_0$ is estimated, practitioners can infer important epidemic quantities such as the total number of infections or the percent of a population needed to be vacccinated to stop the sustained spread of an epidemic.  Moreover, $R_0$ allows us to compare different diseases and different instances of outbreaks on the same scale. }\footnote{cool
  facts about r0, but not the central point}

\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: It's unclear to me why we have a subtitle here - isn't it just more motivation of time-invariant anlysis with $R_0$? Also, I feel like the story is weak here. The point is to leverage $R_0$ to show the value of time-invariant analysis - this seems a bit more like just discussing properties of $R_0$. In the follow rewrite I use "[" and "]" to indicate that this is a section from your earlier draft.]}
\textcolor{orange}{[Shannon says: Tried to tie this better to the previous part since it's no longer a new section.  also highlighted tie to time-invariant analysis and $R_0$.  I also wanted to bring the punch line (overlapping epidemics = same r0) closer to the beginning so those who don't want to slog through mathematical details can get the takeaway.]}\textcolor{orange}{ Shannon tries again in \textcolor{blue}{blue}}

\sout{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: this paragraph needs to still be looked at. Also I'm not sure why this particular paragraph was changed so much at all. Currentlly, the way we present comparing these epidemic's $R_0$s isn't well grouped/motivated.]} \textcolor{orange}{Time-invariant analysis helps practitioners to more easily compare $R_0$ from different outbreaks.} For example, consider two epidemics generated from the Kermack and McKendrick SIR equations. The first epidemic has parameters $\beta_1, \gamma_1 = (0.8,0.4)$ and the second has $\beta_2, \gamma_2 = (0.64,0.32)$.  Both epidemics have populations of 1000 people with 10 individuals initially infected.  Additionally note that the two reproduction numbers are the same for each epidemic, $R_0 = 2=0.8/0.4 = 0.64/0.32$.  We plot the epidemics with traditional $state$ vs. $time$ plots}\footnote{This sentecne is out of place / doesn't connect with the other sentences.}.
\sout{In Fig. \ref{fig:different-scales-standard} we show the time-based paths for the $S$, $I$, and $R$ states for the first 15 days of observed data.  In this time-variant view, we may believe that \textcolor{violet}{epidemic} 1 has a larger $R_0$ than \textcolor{violet}{epidemic} 2 because the peak of infection occurs more quickly than in Epidemic 2.  On the other hand, we may believe \textcolor{violet}{epidemic} 2 has a larger $R_0$ because its unclear if the  number of infections in that \textcolor{violet}{epidemic} has not yet peaked at time 15.  In this time-variant view, we cannot determine if one epidemic has larger value of $R_0$}\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{This sentnce doesn't connect wit previous examples.}}.

\textcolor{blue}{Since $R_0$ is an important value, it would be helpful to have more intuitive ways of comparing one $R_0$ to another.  Usually numerical summaries of $R_0$ are presented, which while overall very helpful, may be confusing when presented along side epidemic data that are visualized in a traditional, time-dependent manner.}

\textcolor{blue}{For example, consider two epidemics generated from the Kermack and McKendrick SIR equations where both have the same value of $R_0$. The first epidemic has parameters $\beta_1, \gamma_1 = (0.8,0.4)$ and the second has $\beta_2, \gamma_2 = (0.64,0.32)$.  Both epidemics have populations of 1000 people with 10 individuals initially infected. An analysis may present an estimate of $\hat{R}_0 = 2$ alongside state vs. time plots like those shown in Figure \ref{fig:different-scales-standard}. The paths of the epidemics in the state vs. time view seem to differ from one another including having different infection peaks. From these traditional time-based plots, there is no intuitive way to conclude that these two epidemics have the same value of $R_0$.}

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\textcolor{blue}{\pkg{EpiCompare} provides a time-invariant tool to visualize these epidemics in a more intuitive manner, at least in regards to comparing values of $R_0$.}
\sout{A time-invariant approach to visualizing epidemics, in comparison, allows us to directly compare $R_0$ from a single plot.}
\textcolor{violet}{For every time \sout{point} $t$ we have a \textcolor{orange}{point} $(S(t),I(t), R(t))$\sout{, so we can treat epidemics as a trajectory in this three-dimensional space, as we visual in the left subplot of Figure \ref{fig:different-sacles-tern}.} \textcolor{orange}{so we can visualize the trajectory of the epidemic in three-dimensional space (see Fig. \ref{fig:different-scales-tern} (left)).} For state space models like in our example, given the constraint that $S(t) + I(t)+R(t)$ is always equal to $N$ (the total population size), we can visual these point in a a two-dimesional \textit{ternary} plot, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:different-scales-tern} (right). \sout{In Fig. \ref{fig:different-scales-tern}
we plot the filamental trajectories of the two epidemics in a time-invariant view. We will explain how and why this works shortly. The important takeaway is that in this time-invariant view, i}I}t
is apparent that these epidemics are on ``the same path.'' In this case,
this indicates that two epidemics have the same value of \(R_0\).

\begin{CodeChunk}

Right: the gray-shaded region and epidemic trajectory shown from (left) now shown in two-dimensional space.  This is more commonly known as a ternary plot.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\textcolor{violet}{Underlying our time-invariant visualization that allowed for the comparison of $R_0$ in Fig. \ref{fig:different-scales-tern} is the treatment of the epidemic as a single filamental trajectory in the state space. \sout{The reason why we can visually compare $R_0$ in Fig. \ref{fig:different-scales-tern} is because of the time-invariant nature of the filamental trajectory associated with an epidemic.}}
A filamental trajectory can be mathematically viewed as a set of points
in space that have an ordering, and that all points on the line between
these ordered points are also contained in the geometric object. For a
SIR epidemic, we can represent the associated filamental trajectory
\(\psi\) as

\[
\psi = \left \{(S(t), I(t), R(t)): S, I, R \ge 0, S + I + R = N \right \}_{t\in[0,T]},
\] where a mapping \(\xi : s \to \mathbb{R}\) that is strictly
monotonically increasing would not change the definition of \(\psi\),
i.e.~\(\psi_\xi \equiv \psi\) where :

\[
\psi_\xi = \left \{(S(\xi(s)), I(\xi(s)), R(\xi(s))): S, I, R \ge 0, S + I + R = N \right \}_{s\in[0,T]}.
\] \textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: removed this paragraph now]} Since the
number \textcolor{orange}{of individuals} in each state is non-negative
and the sum over the three states for a given time point
\sout{sums to}\textcolor{orange}{is} \(N\), then
\textcolor{violet}{all points in} \(\psi\) will lay in a
\textbackslash ben\{two-dimensional triangular plane in
three-dimensional space.
\sout{We can then which can be visualize the \textcolor{orange}{full filamental trajectory} in a two-dimensional ternary plot}
As a result, we can visualize
\textcolor{orange}{the full filamental trajectory} of an epidemic in a
single
\textcolor{violet}{ternary plot \sout{2d plot and ultimately $R_0$}}.
\textcolor{orange}{[Shannon says: Show pic here?]}{]}\footnote{Which?  \textcolor{orange}{3d space one? But I'm leaning against it now.   3d never looks good in a paper.}}

\sout{\textcolor{violet}{[This section could be a bit less wordy. But generally good.]} We visualize the two epidemics in a global, ternary view in Figure \ref{fig:different-scales-tern}.  Without getting into too much detail of the intricacies of this plot, we immediately see the points of the two filaments $\psi$ seem to form the same trajectory.  Now, it is much clearer that \textcolor{violet}{\sout{Model} epidemic} 2 is following the same trajectory as \textcolor{violet}{\sout{Model} epidemic} 1 but is not as far along in the infection process. }

\sout{\textcolor{violet}{As suggested a few paragraphs back, t}}The
filamental trajectories in Fig. \ref{fig:different-scales-tern}
\sout{seem to overlap}, and we may suspect that something is
fundamentally linking these two different epidemics together.
Mathematically, we can show this fundamental link \sout{turns} is
\(R_0\). Let our two epidemics be presented as
\(\{(S_1(t), I_1(t), R_1(t))\}_{t\geq0}\),
\(\{(S_2(s), I_2(s), R_2(s))\}_{s \geq 0}\) respectively. As with the
example, assume both models have the same initial values
\((S(0), I(0), R(0))\), and let
\(R_0 =\frac{\beta_1}{\gamma_1} = \frac{\beta_2}{\gamma_2}\) where
\(\beta_i\) and \(\gamma_i\) are the average infection rate and recovery
rate, respectively, for SIR model \(i=1, 2\). And define \(a>0\) to be
the relative scalar such that \(\beta_2 = a \beta_1\) if and only if
\(\gamma_2 = a \gamma_1\).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:sir-scale}
Let there be two SIR models as described above.  Then for all $t > 0$ there exists an $s>0$ such that $(S_1(t), I_1(t), R_1(t)) = (S_2(s), I_2(s), R_2(s))$.  Moreover, $s = \frac{1}{a}t$.
\end{theorem}

The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:sir-scale} relies on a fairly recent
result from \cite{Harko2014} and is shown in detail in Proof
\ref{proof:thm}. The consequence of Theorem \ref{thm:sir-scale} is that
for two SIR models that have the same initial percent of individuals in
each state and \(R_0\) then for every point on the epidemic path of the
first SIR model \textcolor{violet}{\sout{is also} can be mapped to} a
point on the epidemic path of the second SIR model.
\textcolor{orange}{In other words, the two epidemics form the same filamental trajectory. For SIR models with similar initial state percentages, time-invariant analysis allows practitioners to compare values of $R_0$ at a glance.}

\subsection[Beyond R0 and SIR]{Time-invariant analysis beyond \(R_0\)
and \sout{Kermack’s and McKendrick} SIR
Models\footnote{Probably will need to change this title...}}\label{sec:beyond-r0-sir}

Through the \(R_0\) example, we see that treating epidemics like
filamental trajectories embedded in a lower dimensional space allows us
to \sout{better}\textcolor{orange}{more fully} compare the overall
structure of the epidemic and see how the population is directly
impacted. Time-invariant tools \sout{that} can be useful even when the
underlying generative model for the epidemic is unknown or have more
than three epidemic states.

\textcolor{violet}{New paragraph} Viewing epidemics as filamental
trajectories provides \sout{a lot }new ways to compare and examine
epidemics in a time-invariant manner. \textbackslash ben\{For
\textcolor{orange}{completed?}epidemics that have ended, one way to
examine their filamental trajectories is to
\sout{redefine}\textcolor{orange}{represent} the
\textcolor{orange}{filamental} trajectory as a
\textcolor{orange}{finite sequence of equally spaced points.}
\sout{finite sequence of points on the filamental trajectory that are equally spaced (i.e. equa-distance between pairs of ordered points).}
\sout{For epidemics that have "played" themselves out, one way to represent their filamental trajectories to avoid \textcolor{orange}{confusion stemming from}\sout{impacts of} temporal structure is to define them as a sequence of points their trajectory with equi-distance between each point \textcolor{orange}{[Shannon says: are we missing a few words in this definition?]}}.
This representation induces a natural distance between this type of
representation between epidemics, specifically: \[
d_\text{equi-distance}(\psi_1, \psi_2)  = \int_{s \in [0,1]} (\psi_1'(s) - \psi_2'(s))^2 ds
\] where \(\psi_i'(s)\) the point along \(\psi_1\) that is \(s\)
fraction of \(|\psi_1|\) distance away from the start of
\(\psi_i\).\footnote{\textcolor{orange}{I think you're trying to say something about a distance based on the equally space points.  Some clarifying questions:  is $\psi^\prime$ the derivative?  Does proportion make more sense than fraction? or simply $\frac{|\psi|}{s}$? It's only naturally time-invariant if we have a well defined ending point, right?}}
This distance is naturally time-invariant, and can be plugged into
multiple distance-based assessment tools to examine the overall
``extremeness'\,' of points, including pseudo-density estimators and
depth/local depth functions
\citep[for examples see][]{Ciollaro2016, Geenens2017}. These extremeness
estimators can be \sout{very} useful when comparing
\sout{between a setof simulation} \textcolor{orange}{a set of simulated}
epidemics and the true
epidemic\textcolor{orange}{. Moreover these extremness estimators,}
\sout{and does} \textcolor{orange}{} not constrain the number of states
of the
model\sout{, though we recommend projecting the points into the unit simplex}\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{I'm not sure we've talked about this before... \textcolor{orange}{I don't think we have but am wondering if we're getting in the weeds}}}\sout{(by making all values the proportion of the population in the given state)}.

\textcolor{violet}{New paragraph:}
\textcolor{violet}{\sout{If the set of epidemics that one is examining have only gone through a single cycle of the outbreak} If \sout{one} \textcolor{orange}{a practicioner} is interested in understanding \textcolor{orange}{an} epidemic\sout{s} through a single \sout{cycle}\textcolor{orange}{realization} of \sout{their}\textcolor{orange}{its} outbreak}
(before the population of individuals have become susceptible again),
then additional time-invariant tools, including prediction regions can
be leveraged \textcolor{orange}{awk sentence}\footnote{\{\textcolor{orange}{What are we predicting if the epidemic is done? Update 4/6: I'm satisfied.}\}}.
In these settings, \textcolor{orange}{\pkg{EpiCompare} goes}
\sout{we go }a step further and treats epidemics more like geometric
filaments
\textcolor{orange}{(i.e. filamental trajectories without an ordering of points)}
than filamental trajectories. In \pkg{EpiCompare}, we create prediction
regions that contain a the top (\(1-\alpha\)) proportion of simulated
curves by defining geometric regions defined by the union of small
\textcolor{orange}{geometric?} filaments around the subset of
simulations (\sout{subset} \textcolor{orange}{grouped} by measures like
the above pseudo-density estimates or depth estimates). These regions
\sout{look at}\textcolor{orange}{show} where in the state-space we
expect the epidemic to traverse\sout{, and }.
\textcolor{orange}{Additionally, }we can compare prediction regions
defined by different models using
\textcolor{violet}{many set difference distances \sout{the Haussdorf \textcolor{orange}{why Haussdorf specifically?} distance}}
as well as examining how well the truth epidemic matches the simulations
by examining if the epidemic's trajectory lies within the prediction
region. All these \textcolor{orange}{mentioned?} geometric structures
and distance notations apply to epidemics with any number of states, and
at the end of Section \ref{sec:overview} we \sout{also} highlight how
these prediction regions can aid in visual comparisons for epidemics
with 3 states (like the SIR models).

\pkg{EpiCompare}}\label{sec:overview}

    \caption{How \pkg{EpiCompare} supplements and aids in the epidemiological data analysis pipeline.}
    \label{fig:pipeline2}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

In this section, we present the tools implemented in \pkg{EpiCompare}
and explain how they aid in the data analysis pipeline. In Figure
\ref{fig:pipeline2}, we show how our package's functions fit into the
data analysis pipeline introduced in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}. All
front-facing functions in \pkg{EpiCompare} are aimed to be as
user-friendly as possible. We also focus on providing the user
``tidyverse'' style functions, that encourage piping objects from one
function to the next and follow clear ``verb'' naming schemes
\citep{Wickham2019}. Although users can incorporate \pkg{EpiCompare}
into any step in the data analysis pipeline, there are two primary
points of entry. The first point of entry is the very beginning with
pre-processing and visualizing raw data, and the second point of entry
is after modeling and simulation. Figure \ref{fig:pipeline2} captures
these different paths, and we highlight how to leverage \pkg{EpiCompare}
functionalities in the subsections below.

\textbf{Data pre-processing}

The first step of most data analysis is ``cleaning'' the raw data so it
can be explored. Before data can be explored, they must be collected.
Sometimes individual records are collected, with times of different
states of the epidemic (infection, recovery, etc.) as well as individual
information like network structure, location, and sub-population
information. Other data collections focus on aggregate counts of
individuals in each epidemic state. In fact, many times only the number
of new infections at each time step (e.g.~weekly case counts) is
observed. In this setting, compartment totals (amounts of individuals in
each state) are then imputed from those case counts and using other
information about the disease and the population of interest. In
\pkg{EpiCompare}, we focus on understanding the overall impact of an
outbreak at the aggregate/population level, which allows for streamlined
examination of overall trends of an epidemic.

To help the practitioner examine epidemics from an aggregate/population
lens, we provide a function called \texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()}.
This function transforms data about individual/agents' initial entry
into each state (e.g.~start of infection, start of recovery, etc.) to an
aggregate view of how many individuals were in a state at a given time.
Researchers, including \citet{rvachev1985,anderson1992,worby2015}, often
are interesting in more granular trends that can be detected by
aggregation, conditional on subpopulations (e.g.~subpopulations defined
by age or sex). By combining the function
\pkg{dplyr}::\texttt{group\_by()} and \texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()},
\pkg{EpiCompare} provides group level aggregation.

Besides aiding subpopulation analysis, \texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()}
can accommodate a wide range of information about each individual. In
fact, this function can account for infinitely many states. This
functionality allows the practitioner to aggregate information relative
to common states (e.g.~``Susceptible'', ``Infectious'', and
``Recovered'') as well as more complex states (e.g.~``Exposed'',
``iMmune'', ``Hospitalized''). Additionally,
\texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()} permits indicators for death/exit and
birth/entry dates. Overall, this function is a powerful tool for
pre-processing data.

\textbf{Exploratory data analysis (EDA)}

In the early stages of a project, familiarizing oneself with the data
usually means figuring out useful combinations of visualizations and
numerical summaries of the data both at population and subpopulation
level. An expert coder can start with \texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()}
to successfully accomplish exploratory data analysis (EDA) in many ways.
\pkg{EpiCompare} also includes tools that allow a novice coder to
rapidly explore data, provided there are three unique epidemiological
states (like in the SIR model). Building on \pkg{ggplot2} and
\pkg{ggtern} packages, \pkg{EpiCompare}'s \texttt{geom\_aggregate()}
provides a way to explore how different subpopulations experience of an
epidemic \citep{Wickham2016, Hamilton2018}. The function
\texttt{geom\_aggregate()} provides a visualization tool to holistically
examine aggregate level information across different subpopulations by
visualizing each subpopulation's epidemic trajectory in the
three-dimensional state space. Visualization tools for three-state
models were developed because SIR models are some of the most common and
basic epidemic state-based models and our three-dimensional simplex
representation of these epidemics emphasizes a time-invariant
representation of the data (for a refresher see Section
\ref{sec:time-invariant}).

\textbf{Model fitting and simulations}

After getting a sense of what a past or current epidemic looks like with
EDA, the next step in the data analysis pipeline is often model fitting
and/or simulation. While \pkg{EpiCompare} does not focus on fitting
models to data, we do provide some flexible functions for simulation of
basic discrete-time epidemic-state models. These functions simulate
individual-level information based on practitioner estimated transition
rates between states and can be combined with
\texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()} to view these simulations through an
aggregate lens. The function \texttt{simulate\_SIR\_agents()} simulates
a basic SIR epidemic with user inputs for the number of simulations, the
initial number in each state, the infection and recovery parameters
\((\beta, \gamma\)), and the total number of discrete time steps. Beyond
SIR models, the function \texttt{simulate\_agents()} takes as input a
user-specified state-transition matrix and other epidemic parameters to
allow the user to create simulations for an outbreak with \textit{any}
number of states and any number of transitions among them. This
flexibility in states can be used to also reflect group-based dynamics.
Both of these functions allow users to explore the space of models in an
intuitive way without getting bogged down by too much mathematical
detail. For consistency, we have made output from
\texttt{simulate\_agents()} and \texttt{simulate\_SIR\_agents()}
compatible with \texttt{agents\_to\_aggregate()} so aggregate
information may easily be accessed.

\textbf{Post-processing}

If practitioners wish to compare models-to-observations or even
models-to-models, they need to post-process their models and simulations
to disseminate the results in an easily digestible format. In
\pkg{EpiCompare}, we provide (1) functions to standardize simulation and
model output from external packages and (2) a function to transform
standardized simulation and model output into a format amenable to
time-invariant analysis.

Modeling and simulation output can be very complex objects, and as a
result, a number of epidemic modeling \proglang{R} packages return a
special class. The special classes often contain a plethora of
information about residuals, model diagnostics, input parameters, and
more. While incredibly useful, these special classes can be difficult
for novice coders to handle. To this end, \pkg{EpiCompare} provides a
series of fortify-style methods, called \code{fortify_aggregate()} which
transform output from infectious disease modeling and simulation
packages like \pkg{pomp} and \pkg{EpiModel} into tidy-styled data frames
which contain information about the total number of individuals in each
state at a given time, for a given simulation. These fortify functions
have output that is consistent with that of
\code{agents_to_aggregate()}. These standardized outputs can then be
piped to summaries, tables, and plots.

Because epidemic data is stored in a temporal way, we provide the
function, \code{filament_compression()}, to transform temporally defined
epidemics to their filamental representations. These filaments can then
be fairly compared to one another or passed to further time-invariant
analysis tools described below.

\textbf{Comparisons and assessment}

The last step of the data analysis pipeline often ends with plots,
tables, and summary statistics that are used to assess model performance
and compare across models or simulations. In \pkg{EpiCompare} we provide
a set of comparison and assessment tools for model and simulation
results that extend beyond the standard performance metrics (e.g.~mean
squared error or AIC) and into the lens of time-invariant analysis. We
have found that these tools are specifically applicable for situations
where only one season or cycle of an epidemic has occurred or is the
object of interest.

The first set of of tools surround the creation of prediction regions.
We can create a prediction regions from model simulations to examine if
our model simulations capture the true epidemic trajectory. We do so in
a time-invariant way and utilizing filamental representations of the
model simulations and the true epidemic. For three-state epidemic
models, we provide the \texttt{ggplot}/\texttt{ggtern} extension
\texttt{geom\_prediction\_band()} which creates a prediction region
around the top \(1-\alpha\) proportion of the simulations. In this
visual setting, comparing this prediction region to the true epidemic
trajectory can be done by eye. In \pkg{EpiCompare}, we also provide
these prediction regions for epidemic models with with more than three
states. The functions \texttt{create\_convex\_hull\_structure()} and
\texttt{create\_delta\_ball\_structure()} create different geometric
representations of prediction regions for any dimensional state-based
model. For both of these geometric structures, we provide functions to
check if a path is contained (\texttt{contained()}){]}. We can also use
these prediction regions to visually or mathematically compare how
similar two sets of simulations are. In \pkg{EpiCompare} we provide the
\texttt{hausdorff\_dist()} function to calculate the Hausdorff distance
between multiple prediction regions, when visual comparison is not
possible.

We also provide functions to calculate the ``extremeness'' of a true
epidemic trajectory compared to simulated epidemics via the
equi-distance filamental trajectory representation as mentioned in
Section \ref{sec:beyond-r0-sir}.{]} We provide implementations of a few
distance-based score functions that capture how ``reasonable'' an
epidemic is relative to other epidemics, and these scores can be turned
into an extremeness measure with
\texttt{mean(sim\_scores\ \textgreater{}\ truth\_score)}.
{[}Specifically, functions like
\texttt{distance\_pseudo\_density\_function()} can calculate a
pseudo-density estimate of the true epidemic relative to simulated ones.
Functions \texttt{distance\_depth\_function()} and
\texttt{local\_distance\_depth\_function()} provide depth scores that
suggest how geometrically central an epidemic is to simulations.

\section[Tour]{A tour of \pkg{EpiCompare}}\label{sec:tour}

\textcolor{orange}{I have substantially overhauled section 4.  The older versions are kept after the entirety of this section but note that much of the text (but not the structure) of this section is different.  I've tried to better motivate why we use the epicompare functions to answer our questions of interest.}

\textcolor{orange}{[[NEWEST TEXT}

To conclude our paper, we demonstrate how \pkg{EpiCompare} can
streamline the data analysis process with a case study of a measles
outbreak in 1861-1862 Germany. With the help of \pkg{EpiCompare}, we can
answer questions such as is a SIR model a good fit for the data, does
the outbreak spread differently within the different school classes of
the children, and can incorporating an underlying network structure
enhance model fit. We first begin with some context for the epidemic.

\hypertarget{background-for-1861-1862-measles-epidemic}{%
\subsection{Background for 1861-1862 measles
epidemic}\label{background-for-1861-1862-measles-epidemic}}

We analyze an outbreak of measles in the town of Hagelloch, Germany from
1861-1862, a data set organized by \cite{pfeilsticker1863}. The data was
later made visible by \cite{oesterle1992} and made available in an
\proglang{R} by \cite{surveillance2017}. In this outbreak, 188 children
were infected with measles over the course of three months. This data
set includes a rich collection of features including day of measles
rash, age, sex, school class, household and household location, and
alleged infector of each child. We show a subset of the data in Table
\ref{tab:hags-people}. We are particularly interested if and how group
structure plays a role in the spread of measles.

\hypertarget{pre-processing-and-eda}{%
\subsection{Pre-processing and EDA}\label{pre-processing-and-eda}}

We begin our analysis by first examining and transforming the raw data
(\code{hagelloch_raw}), which is individual-level data. With
\pkg{EpiCompare}, we can quickly determine how the epidemic progresses
through the population at an aggregate level. By specifying the time of
infection (\code{tI}) and the time of recovery (\code{tR}), the function
\code{agents_to_aggregate()} calculates the number susceptible,
infectious, and recovered individuals at each time step. Once
aggregated, we can plot the SIR values through a time-invariant lens
using \pkg{ggplot2} and \pkg{ggtern} functions (as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:hag-tern-raw}) or with our custom \code{geom},
\code{geom_aggregate()}, which takes the raw agent data as input.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> hagelloch_sir <- hagelloch_raw %>%
+   agents_to_aggregate(states = c(tI, tR),
+                       min_max_time = c(0, 55)) %>%
+   rename(time = t, S = X0, I = X1, R = X2)
R> 
R> 
R> ggplot(hagelloch_sir, aes(x = S, y = I, z = R))+

+   geom_path() +
+   labs(x = "S", y = "I", z = "R",
+        title = "Time invariant view of Hagelloch measles outbreak") + 
+   theme_sir(base_size = 24)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{Figs/unnamed-chunk-4-1} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:hag-tern-raw}Time invariant view of the Hagelloch epidemic where we view the individuals in Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered states.  We see there are two peaks of infection (the vertical axis).}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-4}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

In Figure \ref{fig:hag-tern-raw}, we can focus on the infections over
time by analyzing the vertical axis. Specifically, we see two peaks of
infection. This is interesting because the SIR model, which is sometimes
used to model the spread of measles, generally has one defined peak of
infection. We may wonder if the two peaks in the observed data may be
due to random noise or if a model more complex than the simple SIR is
needed to adequately capture these two peaks.

Previous study tells us that measles outbreaks are often associated with
children within the same grade level, and we examine if this is the case
here. By combining the function \code{facet_wrap()} with
\code{geom_aggregate()} we can easily analyze this scenario,

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> hagelloch_raw %>%
+   ggplot(aes(y = tI, z = tR, color = CL)) +
+   geom_aggregate(size = 2) + coord_tern() +
+   labs(x = "S", y = "I", z = "R",
+        color = "Class") +
+   scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
+   facet_wrap(~CL)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{Figs/unnamed-chunk-5-1} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:tern-class-data}Time invariant outbreak curves for the three class groups.  The pre-school class has a distinct peak of infection whereas the peak infection point for the other two classes are less well defined.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-5}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Immediately in Fig. \ref{fig:tern-class-data}, we see that time
invariant infection curve is different for the pre-school class compared
to the 1st class. In the 1st class, we see about 95\% of the class
become infected and less than 10\% of them having recovered, which may
be indicative of a super-spreading event. This suspicion is further
supported in that 26 of the 30 1st class students have been reportedly
infected by the same individual. We now have some evidence that class
structure may play a role in the spread of infection. We can further
analyze this claim with modeling and simulation.

\hypertarget{modeling-and-simulation}{%
\subsection{Modeling and Simulation}\label{modeling-and-simulation}}

We first try to model the Hagelloch data with a baseline stochastic SIR
model, which we refer to as the `simple SIR.' In our full vignette
\textcolor{orange}{(available online),} we show how to fit this simple
SIR model via maximum likelihood, a common approach used to fit
parameters, and simulate from the model with those best fit parameters.
Our function \code{simulate_agents()} (or \code{simulate_SIR_agents()})
generates individual level data according to discrete-time multinomial
draws, which depend on the number of individuals in each state at the
previous time step and a matrix of transition probabilities. For
example, the below code generates 100 simulations of an outbreak of a
disease with one initial infector in a population of \(n= 188\)
individuals, a scenario analogous to the actual outbreak.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> trans_mat <- matrix(c("X0 * (1 - X1 * par1 / N)", "X0 * X1  * par1 / N", "0",
+                   "0", "X1 * (1 - par2)", "par2 * X1",
+                   "0", "0", "X2"), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> set.seed(2020)
R> 
R> best_params <- c("beta" = .36, "gamma" = .13)
R> ## This is the SIR representation
R> 
R> rownames(trans_mat) <- c("S", "I", "R")
R> init_vals <- c(187, 1, 0)
R> par_vals <- c(par1 = best_params[1], par2 = best_params[2])
R> max_T <- 55
R> n_sims <- 100
R> 
R> agents <- simulate_agents(trans_mat,
+                        init_vals,
+                        par_vals,
+                        max_T,
+                        n_sims,
+                        verbose = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> agg_model <- agents %>% group_by(sim) %>%
+   agents_to_aggregate(states = c(I, R)) %>%
+   mutate(Type = "Simple SIR")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The result of our simulation is the object \code{agents} which is a
18800 \(\times\) 5 data frame, which details the time of entry into the
\(S\), \(I\), and \(R\) states for a given simulation. Ultimately, we
would like to know if this simple SIR model is a good fit to the data,
especially in comparison to a SIR model where we can incorporate the
class structure.

To fit a more complex SIR model with a network structure, we use package
\pkg{EpiModel} \citep{Jenness2018}. The below code sets up a network of
individuals (which includes class as a variable) and then simulates
infections over this network.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> library(EpiModel)
R> ## WARNING:  Will take a minute or two
R> 
R> set.seed(42)
R> nw <- network.initialize(n = 188, directed = FALSE)
R> nw <- set.vertex.attribute(nw, "group", rep(0:2, each = 90, 30, 68))
R> formation <- ~edges + nodematch("group") + concurrent
R> target.stats <- c(200, 300, 200)
R> coef.diss <- dissolution_coefs(dissolution = ~offset(edges),  duration = 5)
R> est1 <- netest(nw, formation, target.stats, coef.diss, edapprox = TRUE)
R> 
R> param <- param.net(inf.prob = 0.1, act.rate = 5, rec.rate = 0.1)
R> status.vector <- c(rep(0, 90), rep(0, 30), rep(0, 67), 1)
R> status.vector <- ifelse(status.vector == 1, "i", "s")
R> init <- init.net(status.vector = status.vector)
R> control <- control.net(type = "SIR", nsteps = 55,
+                        nsims = 100, epi.by = "group")
R> epimodel_sir <- netsim(est1, param, init, control)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The output of this network model is \code{epimodel_sir}, an object of
class \code{netsim}, which contains a plethora of modeling information.
In the following section, we will use the capabilities of
\pkg{EpiCompare} to streamline the process of comparing the two models
contained in the objects \code{agg_model} (the simple SIR) and
\code{epimodel_sir} (the network SIR model).

\hypertarget{post-processing-and-comparison}{%
\subsection{Post-processing and
comparison}\label{post-processing-and-comparison}}

The next step is to compare the simple SIR model to the EpiModel SIR
model. The \pkg{EpiCompare} function \code{fortify_aggregate()}, takes
in an object from specialized classes of modeling output
\textcolor{orange}{(like those made by \code{netsim()})} and transforms
it into a tidy-style data frame.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> fortified_net <- fortify_aggregate(epimodel_sir, 
+                                    states = c("s.num", "i.num", "r.num")) %>%
+   mutate(Type = "EpiModel SIR",
+          sim = as.numeric(gsub("sim", "", sim)))
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

With the two modeling objects both in the same format, we can then
compare the models side-by-side. The results are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:hag-simple-sir}, where a 90\% prediction region is estimated
for the two models. For the Simple SIR model, we see that while the
prediciton region covers the data fairly well, the prediction region
clearly misses the second peak of infection. This indicates that the
simple SIR is not a good fit to our data. We also see that the
prediction region is very large, covering up a large area of the ternary
plot. Together, this indicates that the simple SIR model produces a
biased model with a large amount of variance. On the other hand, for the
EpiModel network model, we see that the prediction region covers the
data quite well and takes up less area. With \pkg{EpiCompare}, we can
see that the model using the class structure is a better fit to the
outbreak than the simple SIR model.

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The prediction region generated by the network model covers the observed
data well, but that does not mean that individual filaments generated
from the network model are good fits to the observed data. We can
further examine the model fits by incorporating these filaments into our
visualization. In Fig. \ref{fig:hag-simple-sir} we show the indivdual
filaments generated from the two sets of models as gray lines. Examining
these, we see that the individual lines typically only have one defined
peak, whereas the data certainly looks like it has two distinct peaks,
likely caused by our assumed super-spreader event.

We can also examine these filaments quantitatively by using functions
that take the distance between the filaments with the observed data. In
the below code, we transform the simulations to a more
computationally-friendly format with the function
\code{filament_compression()}. Following that, we calculate the distance
between the simulated filaments and the observed filament with the
function \code{dist_matrix_innersq_direction()} and calculate the
probability of the truth with respect to those simulations with the
function \code{compare_new_to_rest_via_distance()}. The estimated
pseudo-density of the observed epidemic (relative to the simulations
from either model) is much less likely then \textbf{any} of the
simulations (reported in Table \ref{tab:hags-extreme}). This indicates
that neither of two SIR models are good fits to the data at the filament
level.

In conclusion, \pkg{EpiCompare} allows us to fully examine this outbreak
at every step in the data analysis pipeline (see Fig.
\ref{fig:pipeline2}) in a streamlined fashion. With EDA, we saw evidence
that class structure may be important in the spread of of measles. We
then compared a baseline simple SIR model to a more complicated SIR
model which incorporated a network structure which included the class
structure. Based on the prediction regions generated from these models,
we saw that the network model fit the data much better than the simple
SIR model. However, when we examined the individual filaments generated
by the network model, we found that the data is highly unlikely to be
generated from such a model. For further analysis, we would recommend
looking into models that can more accurately capture super-spreading
events based on the observation that one child was allegedly responsible
for nearly all of his classmates' infections. Overall, this analysis
demonstrates how \pkg{EpiCompare} aids in the data analysis pipeline for
both novice and expert practitioners and coders alike.

To conclude our paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of
\pkg{EpiCompare} with a complete data analysis of a measles outbreak in
1861-1862 Germany. Specifically, we demonstrate how tools in
\pkg{EpiCompare} can be used in each step of the data analysis pipeline

Additionally, we highlight how time-invariant analysis (see Section
\ref{sec:time-invariant}) can be used to enhance understanding of an
outbreak\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: I'm not sure this is necessary to state. Additionally - is it really true do we highlight this?]}}.

\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says:The data introduction could be another subsection. Why does it fit better here?.   Other comment: This paragraph is pretty rambly. It is unclear what you want someone to take away from it. I might suggest highlight the fact that the data is "an ideal testing group for methodology".]}}
Before demonstrating \pkg{EpiCompare}, we provide some context for the
measles outbreak presented
here.\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: this first sentence is pretty sign-post-y yet it only relates to the next few sentences. Update so it's less sign-post-y.]}}
The data was originally organized by \cite{pfeilsticker1863}, later made
visible by \cite{oesterle1992}, and made available in an \proglang{R} by
\cite{surveillance2017}. This data set includes a rich collection of
features including household location, class level, and allged infector
ID, and is an ideal testing ground for methodology in infectious disease
epidemiology
\cite{Neal2004,britton2011,groendyke2012,becker2016}\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: This citation doesn't make sense - should it be "citep"?]}}.
In this data set, there are 188 children who became infected with the
measles over the course approximately 90 days.

Finally, in this section we show how tools from \pkg{EpiCompare} can be
used in each step of the data analysis pipeline shown in Fig.

Hagelloch, Germany from 1861-1862, a data set organized by
\cite{pfeilsticker1863}. The data was later made visible by

\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: Shannon, would you mind reading this whole section over again once we've finished edits for section 2 and 3? This initial paragraph seems to be stating section 3's story.]}}In
this section, we highlight many of the tools available in
\pkg{EpiCompare}. As previously discussed, these tools include data
cleaning; visualization; modeling and simulation; post-processing; and
comparison and model assessment, in accordance with the data analysis
pipeline (Fig. \ref{fig:pipeline}). We show a full data analysis from
beginning to end that can be accomplished in a streamlined and
standardized manner via \pkg{EpiCompare}. {]}{]}

\subsection{Pre-processing and EDA}

\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: The first two sentences is very similar to the data paragraph in the section above. Given it's not really connecting the 2 sections I suggest a rewrite - could move some of this stuff above.]}}The
Hagelloch data include a rich set of features at the individual level,
\textcolor{orange}{and the tools in \pkg{EpiCompare} help with pre-processsing and EDA}.
Recorded features include household members, school level, household
locations, date of first symptoms (prodromes), date of measles rash, and
even the alleged infector. A subset of the data is shown in Table
\ref{tab:hags-people}.
\textcolor{orange}{For example,}\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: I'm unclear of what this is actually an example of.]}}
with \pkg{EpiCompare}, we can easily
\textcolor{orange}{pre-process the data to} obtain the empirical
cumulative incidence function with respect to the measles rash
appearance (variable \code{ERU}) with the following tidy-style function,
\code{agents_to_aggregate()}. The function \code{agents_to_aggregate()}
is a key component of \pkg{EpiCompare}, allowing the user to easily
switch from an individual-level (i.e.~an agent) \sout{view} lens of a
disease to an aggregate \sout{level} lens. For
example\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: Same comment as before.]}},
the below code shows how we can convert the agent data to a cumulative
incidence \textcolor{orange}{plot} of the measles
rash\sout{, in order to see how the disease spread through the population over time.}
We can then compare the cumulative incidence of the rash to the
cumulative incidence of the prodromes, i.e.~the
initial\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: please be clearer on what these could be given you comparing them to start of the rash - which seems like an early symptom to me...]}}
symptoms\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: This action in the analysis pipeline is unmotivated - which naturally makes me want to ask "why would I do this?"]}}.
We do this with the below code, and a part of the cumulative incidence
data output is shown in Table \ref{tab:cif-rash}. The argument
\code{integer_time_expansion} indicates whether we should include all
time points in the recorded range of the data or only when there is a
change in the incidence.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> cif_rash  <- hagelloch_raw %>%
+   mutate(time_of_rash = as.numeric(ERU - min(PRO, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
+   agents_to_aggregate(states = time_of_rash,
+                       integer_time_expansion = FALSE) %>%
+   mutate(type = "Rash")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\end{CodeChunk}

One possible question of interest is the duration between initial onset
of prodromes and the appearance of the measles
rash\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: You don't give a good definition of prodromes above, and you only use the name twice. Is this a super common term in Epi? I find it a bit taxing on the reader to remember what this is referring to.]}}.
Since \code{agents_to_aggregate()} outputs a tidy-style data frame, it
is a simple task to plot the two sets of incidence curves on the same
graph (Fig. \ref{fig:cifs}).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> cif_prodromes <- hagelloch_raw %>%
+   mutate(time_of_PRO = as.numeric(PRO - min(PRO, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
+   agents_to_aggregate(states = time_of_PRO,

+   mutate(type = "Pro")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{I'm confused why Figure 5 is included. What is the conclusion you'd like to take away? / Why do people create plots like this?}}

+        x = "Time (days relative to first prodrome appearance)",

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The real power of \code{agents_to_aggregate()} lies in its ability to
aggregate over any number of pre-specified states. For example, the
Hagelloch data sets contains two columns, \code{tI} and \code{tR}, the
time of infection and recovery, respectively of each individual. We can
then\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: using "then" here captures a very progression step of analysis but I stopped here and asked "what is this following" - and the previous "step" occurred a paragraph back and wasn't described as a direct progression but just a possible thing to do.]}}
plot the SIR values through a time-invariant lens using \pkg{ggplot2}
and \pkg{ggtern} functions (as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hag-tern-raw}) or
with our custom \code{geom}, \code{geom_aggregate}, which takes the raw
agent data as input.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> hagelloch_sir <- hagelloch_raw %>%
+   agents_to_aggregate(states = c(tI, tR),

\end{CodeChunk}

\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{I found this pargraph very unmotivated. I recommend first arguing why we might a care to look into the class subpopulation grouping. And maybe comment that is is a common desire for practioners.}}Moreover,
we can look at the outbreaks of the disease by group within
\code{agent_to_aggregate()} or \code{geom_aggregate()}. This allows us
to examine differences among the different groups of individuals. For
example, we show the time invariant outbreak by class level in Figure
\ref{fig:tern-class-data}. Immediately, we see that time invariant
infection curve is different for the pre-school class compared to the
1st class. In the 1st class, we see about 95\% of the class become
infected and less than 10\% of them having recovered, which may be
indicative of a super-spreading event. This suspicion is further
confirmed in that 26 of the 30 1st class students have been reportedly
infected by the same individual.

\hypertarget{modeling-and-simulation-1}{%
\subsection{Modeling and simulation}\label{modeling-and-simulation-1}}

\footnote{\textcolor{orange}{section headings to align with our pipeline}}

Up to this point, we have used \pkg{EpiCompare} in the context of
observed data. \footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: Why?]}}We also
want to compare statistical models, and \pkg{EpiCompare} aids in that
process via a simple yet flexible individual-level
simulator\sout{, conversion tools for popular epidemic model packages, and model assessments.}
We demonstrate an
example\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: to me this whole section is 1 example - as such this wording is confusing to me.]}}
here.

We first try to model the Hagelloch data with a stochastic SIR model,
which we refer to as the `simple
SIR.'\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: could / should this be thought of as a "base" model?]}}
In our full vignette \textcolor{orange}{(available online),} we show how
to fit this simple SIR model via maximum likelihood and simulate from
the model with those best fit
parameters\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: should you highlight that this is a common approach?]}}.
Our function
\code{simulate_agents()}\textbackslash footnote\{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben Should somethings be said about the }
\texttt{simulation\_SIR\_agents()} \textcolor{violet}{function?]}\}
generates individual level data according to discrete time multinomial
draws, which depend on the number of individuals in each state at the
previous time step and a matrix of transition probabilities. For
example, the below code generates 100 simulations of an outbreak of a
disease with one initial infector in a population of \(n= 188\)
individuals.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> trans_mat <- matrix(c("X0 * (1 - X1 * par1 / N)", "X0 * X1  * par1 / N", "0",
+                   "0", "X1 * (1 - par2)", "par2 * X1",

+   agents_to_aggregate(states = c(I, R)) %>%
+   mutate(Type = "Simple SIR")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The result of our simulation is the object \code{agents} which is a
18800 \(\times\) 5 data frame, which details the time of entry into the
\(S\), \(I\), and \(R\) states for a given simulation.
\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: please motivate - through model comparison?]}}Before
we examine the results of this simple SIR model, we will also examine
another, more sophisticated SIR model, this time from the package
\pkg{EpiModel} \citep{Jenness2018}. Briefly, this model first fits a
contact network to the set of individuals, where the class of the child
is a
covariate\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: Make this connect better to the problem at hand - why do you think you should build this bigger model?]}}.
The model then simulates a SIR-epidemic on that network.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}

R> formation <- ~edges + nodematch("group") + concurrent
R> target.stats <- c(200, 300, 200)
R> coef.diss <- dissolution_coefs(dissolution = ~offset(edges),  duration = 5)
R> est1 <- netest(nw, formation, target.stats, coef.diss, edapprox = TRUE)

R> epimodel_sir <- netsim(est1, param, init, control)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The output of this model is \code{epimodel_sir}, an object of class
\code{netsim}, which contains a plethora of modeling information.
\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: what's the point for this sentence. It also doesn't flow/ connect to previous and later text.]}}

\hypertarget{post-processing-and-comparison-1}{%
\subsection{Post-processing and
comparison}\label{post-processing-and-comparison-1}}

The next step is to compare the simple SIR model to the EpiModel SIR
model. We
provide\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: the phrase "We provide" is very passive / distance from the current demonstration at hand. Moreover section 3 already phrases things this way.]}\textcolor{orange}{more of sentence 2 of ben than 1.}}
the function \code{fortify_aggregate()}, which can take objects from
specialized classes of modeling output
\textcolor{orange}{(like those made by \code{netsim()})} and transform
it into a tidy-style data frame.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> fortified_net <- fortify_aggregate(epimodel_sir, 
+                                    states = c("s.num", "i.num", "r.num")) %>%
+   mutate(Type = "EpiModel SIR",
+          sim = as.numeric(gsub("sim", "", sim)))
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

We can then analyze the results of the two models side by side as
time-invariant\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: this isn't a clear phrrase here - what are you trying to say?]}}
epidemic curves. The results are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:hag-simple-sir}, where a 90\% prediction band is estimated from
the delta
ball\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: this has never been discussed anyway.]}}
method for each of the two models. For the Simple SIR model, we see that
the data generally covers the data fairly well but clearly misses the
second peak of
infection\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: This could be better movitated with talk of model fit...]}}.
We also see that the prediction band is very large, covering up a large
area of the ternary plot. On the other hand, for the EpiModel network
model, we see that the prediction band covers the data quite well and
takes up less area.

\begin{CodeChunk}

However, both models are not a good fit to the filamental path as
opposed to the individual points in \((S, I, R)\)-space. This can
be\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: this is a very passive way to say such things. Try being more direct.]}}
captured with the set of simulations both models predict (gray lines),
which all generally have a single defined peak of infection whereas the
data certainly looks like it has two distinct peaks, likely caused by
our assumed super-spreader event. This observation is backed
up\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: describe this?]}} by the below
analysis that demonstrates that the estimated pseudo-density of the
observed epidemic (relative to the simulations from either model) is
much less likely then \textbf{any} of the simulations (reported in Table
\ref{tab:hags-extreme})\footnote{\textcolor{orange}{Ben, do we want to add another sentence or two explaining the two columns in the table?  The second one I think makes sense to me but not the first.}}
In conclusion, \pkg{EpiCompare} makes it clear that, at a glance, 1) the
EpiModel network model is a better fit than the Simple SIR model, and 2)
the fit is only good at the
\sout{geometric filamental level as opposed to the epidemic trajectory filamental level.}
\textcolor{orange}{individual point level as opposed to the geometric filamental level.}\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{[Ben says: how would this look with the time plots? Do we add value here?]}}

\footnote{\textcolor{violet}{I think this paragraph captures some good goals, but I don't think we've done some of this. For example - we don't really highlight novice/expert usage, and we don't highlight side-by-side comparisons of models.}}Overall,
\pkg{EpiCompare} aids in the data analysis pipeline for both novice and
expert practitioners and coders alike. These tools encourage model and
simulation exploration of many of the existing and well-supported
packages that already exist, and side-by-side comparison thereof.
Finally, we hope that practicioners will consider using time-invariant
analysis when trying to assess and compare epidemics and epidemic
models.

\ref{thm:sir-scale}}

\begin{proof}\label{proof:thm}
\cite{Harko2014} provide an analytical solution for the Kermack and McKendrick equations (Eq. \eqref{eq:sir-ode}) by reparameterizing the ODEs so that $\mathcal{S}(u) = S(t)$, $\mathcal{I}(u) = S(t)$, and $\mathcal{R}(u) = R(t)$ for $0< u_T < 1$ with
\begin{align}\label{eq:harko-odes}
\mathcal{S}(u) &= S(0)u\\
\mathcal{I}(u) &= N - R(0) + NR_0^{-1}\log u - S(0)u \nonumber\\
\mathcal{R}(u) &= R(0) - NR_0^{-1} \log u, \nonumber
\end{align}
and $u$ and t are related by the following integral,
\begin{align*}
    t &= \int_{u}^1 \frac{N}{\beta \tau (N - R(0) + R_{0}^{-1} \log \tau - S(0)\tau)}d\tau \\
    &= \int_{u}^1 \frac{1}{\beta f(S(0), R(0), N, R_0, \tau)} d \tau\\
    &= \int_{u}^1 \frac{1}{\beta f(\tau)} d\tau,
\end{align*}
where we have made the denominator of the integral a function of $N$, the initial values, $R_0$, and $\tau$, which we further condense to $f(\tau)$ for brevity.
Then for a given $t$ we want to find $s$ such that $(S_1(t), I_1(t), R_1(t)) = (S_2(s), I_2(s), R_2(s))$.  Or equivalently, for a fixed $u$ want to find $v$ such that  $\mathcal{S}_1(u) = \mathcal{S}_2(v)$ and then the corresponding $t$ and $s$ are given by
\begin{align*}
    t & = \int_{u}^1 \frac{1}{\beta_1 f(\tau)} d\tau \\
    s & = \int_{v}^1 \frac{1}{\beta_2 f(\tau)} d\tau.
\end{align*}
Note that since the equations in Eq. \eqref{eq:harko-odes} are functions of the initial values and $R_0$, then $u = v$. We then can find a relation for $s$,
    \begin{align*}
    s & = \int_{u}^1 \frac{1}{\beta_2 f(\tau)} d\tau  \\
    & = \int_{u}^1 \frac{1}{a\beta_1 f(\tau)} d\tau \\ 
    &= \frac{1}{a}\int_{u}^1 \frac{1}{\beta_1 f(\tau)} d\tau \\
    &= \frac{1}{a}t.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
